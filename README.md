Some of the questions I wanted to answer:

What were the average salaries of the most common data-related jobs?
How does the data industry compare to other jobs overall?

Data Biases

I know the data from this survey is not a perfect representation of all jobs. It is likely going to skew towards people working in white-collar jobs, and as youâ€™ll see below, women are over 75% of the responses.

Additionally, once I dug into the data based on specific job titles and levels, the number of responses got very small, generally too small to be truly representative.

There are many other sources of salary information out there, I highly recommend consulting multiple sources if you are trying to do research for salary negotiation.

1. **Which author profited the most overall?**
2. **Is there a relationship between the length of an audiobook and its price?**
3. **How has revenue changed over time for the highest profiting authors such as JK Rowling?**
