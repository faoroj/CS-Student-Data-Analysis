Some of the questions I wanted to answer:

What were the average salaries of the most common data-related jobs?
How does the data industry compare to other jobs overall?

## Data Biases:

I know the data from this survey is not a perfect representation. It is likely going to be skewed because as youâ€™ll see, men are over 90% of the responses.

Additionally, once I dug into specific data on preferred programming languages, databases, webframes, etc, the number of responses got very small, generally too small to be truly representative.


## Education:
* **45% had a PhD (2% had a JD or MD or similar)**
* **27% had a masters**
* **27% had a bachelors**

## Gender:

Overall, 77% of the respondents of the survey identified as women, which is likely a bit skewed from reality. Looking at the breakdown of the respondents within data jobs was also skewed compared to reality. Rather than reporting the percentages, looking at trends, Data Analysts had the highest percentage of respondents who identified as women, and Data Scientists had the lowest percentage of women.

## Key Insights:

* Data jobs pay more than average
* Data Science and Data Engineering roles pay more than Data Analyst
* Data Scientists are more likely to have advanced degrees
